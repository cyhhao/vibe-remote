# Gate the unit test suite by running each test file in its OWN process.
#
# Why per-file: several test modules install module-level ``sys.modules`` stubs
# for optional platform deps (slack_sdk, aiohttp, modules.agents.*, core.*) that
# never tear down. Collecting the whole ``tests/`` tree in a single process
# therefore fails at import time as those stubs shadow real packages for later
# modules. Running each file in its own interpreter sidesteps that cross-file
# pollution. Making the stubs fixture-scoped so a single ``pytest tests/`` works
# is tracked separately; until then this is how the unit suite is CI-gated.
#
# CI may pass a shard index and total shard count to split the file list across
# multiple runners while preserving the one-process-per-file isolation.
#
# Excludes ``tests/e2e`` (Docker) and the ``integration`` marker (Docker +
# platform tokens) — those run in dedicated jobs. ``-p no:randomly`` keeps a
# deterministic order if pytest-randomly happens to be installed (no-op when it
# is not), and ``-o addopts=""`` ignores any ambient addopts.
