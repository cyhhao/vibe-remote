# Background and Vision

## Background

Vibe Remote is evolving from a Slack-first chat bot into a broader agent platform. Today the system primarily routes messages to OpenCode/Claude/Codex backends and responds in chat. This creates adoption friction for new users (Slack app setup, tokens, and event delivery) and limits the product surface to a chat-only experience.

We want to commercialize Vibe Remote while keeping a strong open-source core. The OSS path must remain fully usable for self-hosting and privacy-minded users. The commercial SaaS path must provide a true "one-click" experience, stability, and a higher-level agent platform that individuals are willing to pay for.

## Vision

Build a developer-first agent platform where:
- The default path is frictionless (official Slack app + OAuth + one-step local gateway pairing).
- Privacy-first users can self-host with full functionality.
- Vibe's own agent becomes the primary orchestrator, with OpenCode/ClaudeCode as sub-agents for coding execution.
- Over time, a Vibe-native app becomes the primary user interface, with Slack as a trigger and notification channel.
