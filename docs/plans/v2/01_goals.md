# Goals (Long-term and Mid-term)

## Long-term Goals

1. Vibe Agent as Primary Orchestrator
   - Vibe's agent handles intent, planning, routing, tool selection, and final response.
   - OpenCode/ClaudeCode/Codex are specialized sub-agents for coding and execution.

2. Vibe-Owned App
   - A Vibe-native app becomes the main UI for complex interactions.
   - Slack remains a trigger/notification surface, not the primary interface.

3. Sustainable Commercial Model
   - SaaS delivers measurable value (ease, stability, observability, premium agent capabilities).
   - Open-source remains fully functional for private/self-host use.

## Mid-term Goals

1. "One-click" SaaS Onboarding
   - Official Slack app + OAuth install.
   - Automatic workspace binding.
   - Local gateway pairing with a single command.

2. Gateway-First Architecture
   - All code execution stays local in the user's environment.
   - Cloud is responsible for ingress, routing, and reliability (no content persistence).

3. Unified Agent Runtime Model
   - Standardized envelope for requests/responses/traces across transports.
   - Consistent routing and control paths for SaaS and self-host.
